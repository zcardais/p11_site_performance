# Performance_Optimization

Apply the skills learned for optimization of graphics, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to take a poorly optimized site and reduce the total load size to under 1.3mb and total requests to less than 27\. Students will need to analyze the assets they've been provided to see where optimizations can and need to be made, make those optimizations, and measure their success. Multiple analyzation, optimization, and measuring cycles may be required.

## DONE

- Replace social media png with svg
- Compress all photo*.jpg in img/photos directory which reduced size of index.html down from 12mb to 2.9mb
- moved script files to bottom of index.html before closing body tag
- imported all .css files into newly created main.css file
