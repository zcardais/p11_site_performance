<p>Apply the skills learned for optimization of graphics, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to take a poorly optimized site and reduce the total load size to under 1.3mb and total requests to less than 27. Students will need to analyze the assets they&#8217;ve been provided to see where optimizations can and need to be made, make those optimizations, and measure their success. Multiple analyzation, optimization, and measuring cycles may be required.</p>
